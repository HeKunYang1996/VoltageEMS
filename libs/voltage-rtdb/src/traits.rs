/// Unified RTDB Storage Trait
///
/// Provides complete storage interface for VoltageEMS, combining:
/// - Basic key-value operations
/// - Structured data (Hash, List, Set)
/// - Pipeline operations for batch writes
///
/// Implementations:
/// - `RedisRtdb`: Production Redis backend
/// - `MemoryRtdb`: In-memory backend for testing
///
/// # Value contract (IMPORTANT)
///
/// The `Bytes` type appears in many signatures (`set`, `hash_set`, `hash_mset`,
/// `pipeline_hash_mset`) but the **production Redis backend requires valid
/// UTF-8** for the Redis protocol path used here (`SET`/`HSET` go through
/// `fred`'s string API). Callers must pass UTF-8 bytes — typically
/// `Bytes::from(string_data)` or `f64_to_bytes(value)` which emit ASCII.
///
/// Non-UTF-8 input is rejected at runtime with a clear `UTF-8 conversion failed`
/// error rather than silently corrupting the value or panicking. The
/// in-memory backend (used in tests) accepts any bytes, so writing a test
/// that passes binary data will pass against `MemoryRtdb` but fail against
/// `RedisRtdb` — this is the contract.
///
/// A future cleanup should narrow the signatures to `&str`/`String` to make
/// this contract a compile-time check; tracking issue: see review round 4
/// finding #10.
///
/// Note: All async methods use explicit lifetime `'a` to enable zero-copy parameter passing.
/// The returned Future borrows both `&self` and parameters for the same lifetime,
/// allowing implementations to use borrowed data directly without cloning.
