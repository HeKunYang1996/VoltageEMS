//! Atomic per-generation file swap mechanism (Step 3 PR 1).
//!
//! Validates the building blocks that PR 2 will assemble into the full
//! comsrv/modsrv reload protocol:
//!
//! - `generation_file_path` derives staging paths from the canonical path
//! - `UnifiedWriter::create` can be pointed at an arbitrary path via
//!   `SharedConfig::with_path`
//! - `commit_generation_swap` atomically replaces the canonical file with
//!   the staging file
//! - Critical property: **an existing reader holding a mmap of the previous
//!   file continues to see its data** after the swap, while a freshly
//!   opened reader sees the new file. This is what makes the design
//!   tear-free without cross-process coordination — the POSIX inode lives
//!   as long as any mmap references it.
