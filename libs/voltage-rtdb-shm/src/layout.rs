//! Channel slot layout — **business-side**, not part of `core::`.
//!
//! `ChannelLayout` knows the 4 PointType semantics (T/S/C/A) and translates
//! `(channel_id, point_type, point_id)` triples into flat slot indices. This
//! is the adapter between SHM's slot-only world (`core::slot::PointSlot`,
//! addressed by usize) and the channel/point-type vocabulary that comsrv
//! and modsrv speak.
//!
//! Long-term direction: when SHM core is promoted to a standalone crate,
//! this module stays in the business adapter. The header on-mmap already
//! captures the layout fingerprint as `routing_hash` (a manifest hash);
//! `ChannelLayout` itself never crosses the process boundary — it is
//! re-derived in each process from the same `ChannelPointCounts` source.

/// - the C/A region starts on a fresh cache line when the channel has any
///   C/A points (covers the in-channel T/S → C/A boundary)

/// Cost: ≤1 padding slot (32 B) per boundary. Padding slots are never
